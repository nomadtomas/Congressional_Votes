## General Information
<p>The U.S. Congress consists of two chambers: House of Representatives (435 voting representatives) and the Senate (100 senators).  Hundreds of bills are presented to the floor to be voted on each year.  However, outside pundits, political reporters, or lobbyist most people will not know how each congress member voted.  As part of being an informed electorate it is important to understand how our elected officials are voting on each bill.  This repo is designed to get the voting records of both the Senate and House.</p><hr>
